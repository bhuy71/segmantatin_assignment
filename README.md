To test with an image, firstly , you have to download my checkpoint at:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S82Ufh5kNh7E5nysrheh1iPbIaQMb0Qt/view?usp=drive_link
I have prepared an image at image.jpeg, you only need open cmd and run:python infer.py --image_path image.jpeg , then the output will be saved at segment_output.png and you can see it.
